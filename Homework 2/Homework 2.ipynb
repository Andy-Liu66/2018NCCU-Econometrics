    "### 1. One argument of the existence of the CAPM alpha is the explanatory power of the CAPM, or lack thereof. You might have an excellent performance in your portfolio in the first homework because you take on higher risks that can only be captured by SMB or HML, or even UMD, but not by the market factor. Please examine whether your portfolio alpha is still significant with equation (1) and (2) to compare the intercept to the alpha with the CAPM. Use the original sample period to estimate the beta of the firms in homework 1 (2008-2012) and test for both high- and low-alpha portfolios and see if the alphas are still as large/small as they were. (Note: make a table for the parameters of different models and discuss.)"
